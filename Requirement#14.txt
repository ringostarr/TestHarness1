Differences between Prototype and OCD in Project#3

1. The XML is created and being sent to the server in the project but in the OCD it was supposed to be only the data structure containing test request details

2. Logger implemented does not contain a queue whereas it was mentioned in the OCD.

3. Loader is responsible for Dequeuing the messages and checking if a thread is free in the implementation whereas it was a queueing modules job in the OCD.
